# nextjs-mdx-ts-portfolio-and-blog
This is my blog and portfolio site, I plan to use it as a place where I experiment different integrations to my next.js site, and a place where my upwork clients can learn more about me, get a bit of insight in my mind, and maybe get something good to read about Javascript, CSS, Design, Crypto, Animation, and a lot about the World Wide Web
